Cereal
======

This is a modular nosql storage system for small-scale experimental systems, because making websites is supposed to be fun.

It is written in PHP, because it is the language of the DIY web. The goal is to make something easy and useful for other diy projects. Cereal is a module that can be integrated with other modules in a modular fashion. Think Modular Synths for the web.

Currently only XML is support. Mysql is almost done. There are plans for many other implementations of the Cereal interface.
